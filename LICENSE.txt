"My ComfyUI Nodes License" (1.0)

This license outlines how you can use my ComfyUI nodes. My goal is to share
my work for free personal use while ensuring it remains my creative project.

What You Are Free To Do:

• Use Freely: You are welcome to use this node in any of your ComfyUI
workflows, free of charge and forever. This applies whether you are an
individual, a company, or any other entity.

• Personal Modifications: You, as an individual user, are permitted to modify 
the source code solely for your own personal use to better fit your individual 
workflows. Such modifications may not be distributed or standardized for use 
by others within an organization.

What Is Not Permitted:

• No Rebranding: You may not modify the source code with the intention of
rebranding it or releasing it as your own tool.

• No Code Reuse: You may not reuse any part of the source code in other
projects without my explicit written permission.

• No Bundling: You may not include this node as part of any other software
package or collection.

• Restricted Distribution: This node should only be distributed from its
original repository. Please do not host it elsewhere. The original repository 
like my other repositorys are located at https://github.com/quasiblob/.

Why These Restrictions?

I create these tools primarily for my own use and to showcase my skills as a
creative individual. These guidelines help maintain the integrity of my work.
If your specific use case seems unclear or falls into a gray area, please
feel free to reach out and ask.
